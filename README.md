# Restaurant-Bill-Calculator
This is an app built to calculate table's bill.
The app displays all the menu items from the table in four ComboBoxes. Each ComboBox contains a category of food offered by the restaurant (Beverage, Appetizer, Main Course and Dessert), along with their prices.
The Listbox shows the selected food items from the ComboBoxes. The user can choose from one of the ComboBoxes to add an item to a tableâ€™s bill. 
On selecting a food item, it adds the item to a ListBox and its price to subtotal. Then it Calculates tax and total at the same time as well. 
On clicking on the clear button, the subtotal, taxes and total are restored to $0.00.
